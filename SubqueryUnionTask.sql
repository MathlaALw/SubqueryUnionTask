-- Topics:
-- 1. UNION / UNION ALL
-- 2. DROP vs DELETE vs TRUNCATE
-- 3. Subqueries (exploratory task � they search and try it)
-- 4. Transaction & Batch Script (exploratory and guided)
-- 5. *Hands-on comparison with real effect on data
-- Practice Scenario: Training & Job Application System
-- Your institute is managing two main datasets:
-- � Trainees: People who complete training at your institute.
-- � Job Applicants: External applicants who apply directly to job posts.
-- Your goal is to:
-- � Compare the data of both groups.
-- � Clean or restructure the database safely.
-- � Explore more advanced SQL topics on your own (subqueries, transactions).
